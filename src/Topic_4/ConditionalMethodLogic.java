/*
Challenge 1 — Conditional Method Logic

Description:
    Create a method gradeLevel(int score) that returns a String following these rules:
        score < 60 → "Fail"
        60–79 → "Pass"
        80–89 → "Good"
        ≥ 90 → "Excellent"
Call the method with 5 different values and print each result.
Goal: Use methods + control flow + return values efficiently.
