/*
Exercise 5 – Combine Everything (Mini‑Application)

Task
Build a small program that manages a list of names (maximum capacity 20). The program should present a menu with these options:

    Add name – locate the first free slot in the array using a for loop.
    Search name – ask for a name and traverse the list with a while loop; report whether it was found.
    Delete name – ask for a name; if found, remove it by shifting subsequent elements left (use a for loop).
    Show all – print the entire list using an enhanced for‑each loop.
    Exit – terminate the program.

Use a switch statement for the menu and incorporate break, continue, and the various loops where appropriate.

What you’ll practice

    Array manipulation.
    Integration of switch, several loop types, and flow‑control statements (break, continue).
