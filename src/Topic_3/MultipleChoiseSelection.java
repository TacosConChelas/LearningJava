/*
Exercise 2 – Multiple‑Choice Selection (switch)

Task
Create an interactive menu that lets the user choose an operation on two integers x and y:
Option	Action
1	Add (x + y)
2	Subtract (x - y)
3	Multiply (x * y)
4	Divide (x / y) – handle division‑by‑zero gracefully
5	Exit

Use a switch statement to process the selected option. The menu should keep appearing until the user chooses “Exit”.

What you’ll practice

    switch with case and default.
    Looping with while to repeat the menu.
    Simple error handling (division by zero).
