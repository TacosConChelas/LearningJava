/*
Exercise 3 – for Loop with continue and break

Task
Print the numbers from 1 to 100 applying these rules:

    If the number is a multiple of 3, skip printing it (continue).
    If the number is a multiple of 7, stop the loop entirely (break).

After the loop finishes, display how many numbers were actually printed.

What you’ll practice

    Classic for loop syntax.
    Using continue and break together.
    Maintaining a counter variable.
